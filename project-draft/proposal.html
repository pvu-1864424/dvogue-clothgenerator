       <h2>Problem & Data Domain:</h2>
       <section class="problem-section">
        <p>Nowadays, people pay more attention to their outfits of the day(OOTD) and outfit matching.
        However, despite the considerable time they spent, still, the final illustration may not be
        good as people expected, thus comes the problem of dressing difficulties for people's daily needs.
        There are some websites that address with helping and recommending outfits for people. For example,
        the website called  <a href=" https://dresoo.com/">Dresso</a> helps people find, mix and match randomly of
        the whole outfit until they find the one they like. Dreeso's outfits can be directly purchased from
        their website and all the clothes are the web's own brand. There are other existing attempts
        like <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">“Stitch”</a> which people take a style quiz and stitch's stylists
        will give tips for outfits based on the user's budget and style. The website is collaborating with
        hundreds of brands like Nike, the Northface…and people can shop for different brands on this website.
        Based on the existing cloth matching platform, one problem worth noticing is that most of them didn't
        take the occasions and weather into consideration, rather simplifying classify the categories based on
        the cloth types. In this way, it can't really resolve the user's demand when there is a special event to
        attend or encounter harsh weather. Also, we found almost all the existing attempt have their own shopping
        function while some users might not trust the source and quality of the outfit bought through their outfit
        platform. In addition, the existing attempts take a lot of steps before recommending the outfits are
        user-unfriendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, by this chance, we aim to construct an outfit planner platform for users to fulfill their
            different needs of daily dressing, by incorporating the condition that other websites didn't include.

             social class, people usually have difficulties choosing or coordinating their clothes into a suitable outfit. 
             Our application targets the group of users who want to look good or are struggling with choosing the appropriate 
             clothes for specific occasion, weather, or just daily life. Thus, the target users would not be limited by any 
             categories like gender, background, social class, … etc. While browsing our web application, our users will be able 
             to see a variety of outfits. For example, trousers, pullovers and dresses are some of the clothing we offer to our 
             users to select. Throughout our website, we offer information about clothing that is suitable for people of all ages 
             and backgrounds. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog"> The dataset</a>

              <a href="https://www.myntra.com/">Myntra</a>, a fashion e-commerce company.
        </p>
        <p>The users would use our web application as a platform to customize their “clothes closet”, which can contain their current clothes, 
            clothes that they intend to buy, their “saved” or wishlist of clothes. On top of the personalized section, the users can also use the 
            app to get suggestions on how to mix and match different pieces of clothing for daily life or special occasions. Thus, our web application 
            can also act as a “shopping partner” of the user to help them choose from our clothes collection, which is personalized to their budgets, 
            preferences, lifestyles, and even current clothes closet. In order to carry out the web application's mission, we expect our app to support 
            these interactive features:
        </p>
        <ul class="interactive">
            <li>Generate new clothes suggestions based on occasions or weather: The web application is supposed to filter its large database of clothes 
                information based on users' input of the occasion that they are attending, the weather of that day, or types of activities that the users 
                are doing. The output section would also provide links to the products that are being suggested to the users for the users' convenience of shopping.</li>
            <li>Generate appropriate complete outfit from user's personalized section: The web application should provide a button of “Generate”, which would automatically 
                generate a complete good-looking or appropriate outfit from the users' saved clothes in the system. Each time the button is clicked, a different set of outfits 
                would be generated so that the users can generate different outfits until they find their most desired outfit.</li>
            <li>Generate accessories or clothes to complete an outfit with given clothes: The user can choose a piece of clothing from the system and click on the 
                “Search compatible products” button to find all the pieces of clothing and accessories that would go well with or fit their chosen clothes.</li>
            <li>Restrict budget: The web application should be able to filter out all the products in its database, which are more expensive than users' input of budget. 
                This feature should be able to be applied on all services or suggestion results generated across the web.</li>
            <li>A personalized suggestion section on the homepage for the user: the website should be able to filter new inputs of clothes into its database based on users' 
                history or preference of clothes using different categories like color, style, materials,... etc; and display these filtered items in the “Upcoming trend for 
                you” section on the Homepage of the web application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wearing the appropriate clothes would not only satisfy people's physical needs, but also provide them comfort, productivity, 
            others' recognition, happiness, and self-satisfaction. With the features of matching and searching for clothes on our website, 
            we would make users' lives better by providing them with the most suitable outfits for different weather conditions, occasions, 
            as well as activities that they are engaging in. Furthermore, our platform could offer recommendations on the outfit based on the 
            user's input and saved item. The system can automatically generate outfit suggestions for users on the basis of their preferences, 
            and the visitors can browse through the suggestions and select the desired outfit. We also provide our web application with the budget 
            restriction, filter out items according to the user's input, as well as the option for users to pair different outfits with their current 
            clothing.
